These include diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol, and high salt intake and diets with low fruit and vegetable intake. The World Health Report 2002 estimates that approximately 30% of CHD in developed countries is due to fruit and vegetable consumption levels below 600g per day. </p>

            A high alcohol intake increases blood pressure and can increase triglycerides in the blood.
